TPM Qualities & Skills

1. Grasp of Technical Architecture & Design
2. Program Management Skills - Risk, critical part mngmt
3. Emotional intelligence - self awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, social skills
4. Communicating effectively
5. Foresight - Risk mitigating by learning from previous failures


** Technical Aspects:
1. Be the domain expert - Use cases & Implementation - eg : Payment - thourough knowledge 
2. Lead & Participate in Design Reviews - understanding implementation, convert product vision into technical design along with developers
3. Risks taken by technical architecture decisions being made
4. Think ahead - eg: rollout 5% of feature to customers and understand if any improvement to be made, like caching
5. Which team should own a feature - TPM decides
6. Understanding service architecture & behaviour - eg: a micro-service we own is a memory bound, CPU bound, max latency, bottle-necks in your service, an important principle used for service, acronym called, RED - "R" stands for rate of calls we are getting, "E" stands for no. of errors we are getting, "D" stands for delay in no. of calls - how service actually behaves when in production
7. Effects of degradation of a dependant service - 
8. Understand performance, durability, replication, scalability, multi-region support
9. Database replication - capped theorem, database in different regions, disaster in other region
10. Vulnerabilities of our service - what happens when it's down
11. Cost of running our service - how to reduce cost, aware of cost
12. Own RCA & CAPAs - understand when service degrades, root cause of degradation, doing corrective & preventive actions to ensure these degradation does not happen again
