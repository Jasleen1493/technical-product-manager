# What it takes to be a TPM?  <Roles and Responsibilties of TPMs>

1. Product Management : 
PM roles in 2 types of spaces - B2B and B2C

In B2C - example "SPOTIFY", a music straming application - a product manager wants endless music streaming feature, where he needs to define "product vision" and be the "customer voice", communicating their needs to team. Need to understand if it's a "Greenfield Developmemt"- means product starting from fresh or an "enhancement to existing feature"
PM roles - Product vision & customer voice

In B2B - example "AWS", "AZURE"- where business is selling to another business, 2 types of PM : "Inbound PM" - work very closely with dev team to build the product, "Outbound PM" - talk to customers, understands the problem, sell the product itself
PM roles - what needs to be built and why it needs to be built

Focus on "WHY"part - why it needs to be built covers 2 metrics:

2. Communicating effectively & setting expectation - Synced communication at regular cadence, know about stakeholders, what they actually want, status reports revewing
3. Managing upstream and downstream dependencies - Work across several teams, set right expectations with both upstream and downstream teams and communicating effectively and helping them understand where they stand in a pipe
